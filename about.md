Hi. I'm an Apprentice at Cisco aspiring to become a Systems Engineer at Cisco Meraki

In my spare time I like to take photos using analog film cameras. I've got 4 now: 
* A [Nikon F3][nikon f3]
* A [Canon A1][canon a1]
* An [Olympus Trip 35][olympus trip 35]
* And most recently a [Zorki 4][zorki 4]
