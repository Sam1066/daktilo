I figured to own a blog you need to actually have posts, so here we go.
I bought samhastings.co.uk last year for very cheap and never put it to use, so here it is. I'm sure it is very easy to tell that I have stolen this blog template from [kronik3r][kronik3r] on GitHub, becuase I am somewhat useless at web development.

I have a couple of hobbies, though my newest and most expensive has to be analog photography.
I have a [Nikon F3][nikon f3], [Canon A1][canon a1] and a (broken)[Olympus Trip 35][olympus trip 35]. I love them dearly, although I am very much an amature anyway.

I guess thats some stuff, I'm sure I'll make more posts about my hobbies I guess.
